*** Second generation
    BDD is seen as the second generation of TDD.
*** Outside-in
    Approach taking by user stories to specify behaviour. Outcomes are identified first, and then BDD expands to the feature set that achieves these outcomes.
*** Pull-based
    Rather than delievering features by a deadline, user stories are prioritised by their value.
*** Multiple-stakeholder
    Stories are the result of communications between all stakeholders involved.
*** Multiple-scale
    Stories are made at different levels of the feature set.
*** High-automation
    Automated processes are used where possible.
*** Ubiquitous language
    The language of user stories is consistent, transferably beyond one project.
